# MongoSQL needs a lot of information about the properties of your models.
# All this is handled by the following class:
from .bag import ModelPropertyBags

# The heart of MongoSql is in the statements.py file: that's where your JSON objects are
# converted to actual SqlAlchemy queries!
from . import statements

# MongoQuery is the man that parses your QueryObject and applies the methods from MongoModel that
# implement individual fields.
from .query import MongoQuery

# SqlAlchemy declarative base that defines .mongomodel() and .mongoquery() on it
# That's just for your convenience.
from .sa import MongoSqlBase

# CrudHelper is something that enabled you to use JSON for:
# - Creation (i.e. save a record into DB using JSON)
# - Replacement (i.e. completely replace a record in the DB)
# - Modification (i.e. update some specific fields of a record)
# CrudHelper is something that you'll need when building JSON API that implements CRUD:
# Create/Read/Update/Delete
from .crud import CrudHelper, StrictCrudHelper, CrudViewMixin

# Finally, have a look at:
# ./hist.py: an object that gives you access to model history (previous values of changed columns)
