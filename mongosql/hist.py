    """ Proxy object to gain access to historical model attributes.

    This leverages SqlAlchemy attribute history to provide access to the previous value of an
    attribute. The only reason why this object exists is because keeping two instances in memory may
    be expensive. But because normally you'll only need a field or two, the decision was to use
    this magic proxy object that will load model history on demand.

    Why would you need to access model history at all?
    Because CrudHelper's update method (i.e., changing model fields) gives you two objects: the
    current instance, and the old instance, so that your custom code in the update handler can
    compare those fields.
    For instance, when a certain object is being moved from one User to another, you might want
    to notify both of them. In that case, you'll need access to the historical user.

    The initial solution was to *copy* the instance, apply the modifications from JSON to a copy,
    and then feed both of them to the save handler... but copying was expensive.
    That's why we have this proxy: it does not load all the fields of the historical model,
    but acts as a proxy object (__getattr__()) that will get those properties on demand.

         The Session by default autoflushes each time a Query is invoked"
        This means that as soon as you load a relationship, model history is reset.
